# FUT SBC Solver

## Goal

MVP Goal is to create a solver that can solve for the following requirements:

* Chemistry
* Team Rating
* Costs

Example problem:
"Generate a team with a chemistry of 100, rating 85 for maximum of 100.000 coins"

The initial formation to support will be the 4-4-2 formation, but additional formations should be supported in future.
The initial algorithm will solve from a subset of players to have a baseline algorithm and limit the amount of combinations.

## Later versions

* Support nation requirements
* Support club requirements
* Support league requirements

Example problem:
"Generate a team with min. 5 Korean players, max 6. clubs with a rating of min. 85 and chemistry of min. 85"
